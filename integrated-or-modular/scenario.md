# Scenarios

Before we can define our station, we need to think about how we will be using that station.  Let's start off with defining our likely operating location and needs, etcetera.

## Emergency Communications

This operating location could easily be an open field, a tent, in a mobile command post, or a parking lot.  Most likely there will be lots of people around.  I'll probably be operating in a phone or digital mode.

I want to use a station that will give me the best chance at making contact with other EMCOMM stations.  I'm willing to take on station weight and bulk in favor of capability.

## Parks On The Air (POTA)

I'm heading to a park to operate.
I'll be outside.  Most likely at a park bench.
I'll be operating with morse code and phone modes.
I will trade some capability for a more compact station.

## QRP Contest

Very similar to POTA, except the rig doesn't need to be as powerful.

## Summits On The Air (SOTA)

I'll be operating on a summit.  A typically great radio location.
Most likely in an operating position exposed to the elements.
I'll be hiking in to the operating location.  So, my station should be compact and light weight.
I'll want to be able to rapidly setup and tear down my station.  I'm willing to use a compromise antenna if it will help me meet this goal.

## Homework

- Think about and document your portable operating scenarios.
