# Integrated and Modular Stations

The gear available to you, your operating preferences, and your operating scenarios will all have an impact on your station.

## Reflection

- Integrated stations may be more compact.
- Modular stations may give us more choices.
- Depending on your gear and scenarios, you may utilize both approaches.
- Familiarize yourself with the equipment before going portable.
  - Practice in your shack.
  - Practice in your back yard.
  - Practice in your nearby park.
- Use your gear checklists.
- Above all, get out portable and have fun!
