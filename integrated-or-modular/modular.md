# Modular

When creating a modular station definition, we will be specifying _generically_ what gear constitutes the portable station.  

Individual components are packaged so that we can easily build a station for a given scenario.

## Example stations to match with scenarios

### EMCOMM

- 100 watt radio, microphone, paddle, maybe even a computer mode?
- Good antenna, coax, tuner
- power: battery, solar capability, optional power supply
- hard case

### POTA or park bench portable

Similar to above:

- 15-20 watt radio, mode specific gear
- acceptable antenna, coax and tuner
- power: battery, optional solar
- hard case(s), bag, or both

### QRP Contest

- 5/10 watt radio, mode specific gear
- antenna, tuner, transformer
- coax
- hard case(s), bag, or both

### SOTA

- ultra portable radio, mode specific gear
- antenna, tuner, transformer
- coax optional
- bag

## Reflection

When choosing to go the modular path, it will be extremely important to standardize on RF and power connectors.  As trade for the flexibility in choosing station components we may take on additional bulk and weight.

## Homework

- Create a gear pick list for each scenario.
  - With *generic* component names

  - practice creating the modular stations
