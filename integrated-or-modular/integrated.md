# Integrated

In the integrated approach to portable station design, we work to combine all of the station components together.  The amount of integration can vary from components packaged together to a full custom creation.  I am leaning towards the bundling or packaging up of components.  You may want to create a custom enclosure for your station.  Some go even further.  Using existing or custom components to create a whole new _thing_.

Search the EMCOMM and POTA groups and you will find many examples of integrated stations.  These are often in the form of the packaged components integration.  An example here would be a "go box" with equipment mounted on shelves in the box.  Open the box, plug it in and you have your station.

In the SOTA and QRP groups you can find examples of the full custom integrated station.  An example here is taking an LNR MTR4B, shoe horning an Elecraft T1 into it, attaching a paddle to it, and having the log book on the back of the rig.

When creating an integrated station, we will be specifying _explicitly_ what gear constitutes this portable station.

## Reflection

So, we can clearly see that the operating scenarios had a major influence on the equipment we chose for our station.

## Homework

- Use your portable operating scenarios to create a gear list for each scenario.  *Be specific*

- create your integrated station
  - gear list on top of the package
  - non-integrated pre-deploy checklist attached
